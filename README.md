# Discord-CleverBot
 
Discord-CleverBot is a Discord bot developed in JavaScript that uses the node.js library of [cleverbot.io](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cleverbot.io) to give CleverBot a presence on Discord. Through the bot, users are able to converse with the [CleverBot chat bot](https://www.cleverbot.com/). The bot also hosts other features that help integrate it with the Discord chat environment.
This project was started in December 2017 and worked on periodically until May 2019. This included several iterations of rewriting the bot from scratch to improve functionality and efficiency and reduce excessive complexity, leading to a comparatively simple codebase today.

## Notes
> As of May 2019, this bot is non-functional. The library of cleverbot.io seems to have been abandoned by its creator, and has only worked off-and-on in the past. Near the end of May it stopped working again and has not worked since.

> As of September 2020, this project has been revived and switched over to a new API and is working again, thanks to [cleverbot-free](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cleverbot-free).
