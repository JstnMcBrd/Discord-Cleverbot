# Discord-Cleverbot
 
Discord-Cleverbot is a [Discord](https://discord.com/) bot developed in JavaScript that uses the node.js library of [cleverbot-free](https://www.npmjs.com/package/cleverbot-free) to give Cleverbot a presence on Discord. Through the bot, users are able to converse with the [Cleverbot chat bot](https://www.cleverbot.com/). The bot also hosts other features that help integrate it with the Discord chat environment.

This project was started in December 2017 and worked on periodically until October 2021. This included several iterations of rewriting the bot from scratch to improve functionality and efficiency and reduce excessive complexity, leading to a comparatively simple codebase today.
