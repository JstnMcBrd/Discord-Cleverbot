# Discord-CleverBot
 
Discord-CleverBot is a Discord bot developed in Javascript that uses the node.js library of [cleverbot.io](https://cleverbot.io/) to give CleverBot a presence on Discord. Through the bot, users are able to converse with the [CleverBot chat bot](https://www.cleverbot.com/). The bot also hosts other features that help integrate it with the Discord chat environment.

## Note
As of May 2019, this bot is non-functional. The library of cleverbot.io seems to have been abandoned by its creator, and has only worked off-and-on in the past. Near the end of May it stopped working again and has not worked since.
Update: As of July 2020, cleverbot.io library is still non-functional.
